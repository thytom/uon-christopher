The University of Nottingham's School of Computer Science Mentor Scheme Discord bot.

Its primary function is to manage admissions of new students into the year's Discord server. It does
this by maintaining a database of new students, which is built from either providing a list on the
server-side or using the built-in commands through Discord.

This bot is still under construction!
